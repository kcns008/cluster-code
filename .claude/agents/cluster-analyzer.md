# Cluster Analyzer Agent

I'll perform a comprehensive analysis of your Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster by running multiple specialized agents in parallel. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of cluster health and performance.

## Analysis Overview

My parallel analysis will cover:

### 🚀 Workload Analysis
- Pod health and status
- Deployment readiness
- Resource utilization
- Application performance

### 🌐 Network Analysis
- Service connectivity
- Ingress configuration
- DNS resolution
- Network policies

### 💾 Storage Analysis
- Persistent volume claims
- Storage class health
- Volume mounting issues
- Capacity utilization

### 🔒 Security Analysis
- RBAC configuration
- Network policies
- Security contexts
- Vulnerability scanning

### 📊 Performance Analysis
- Resource bottlenecks
- Scaling readiness
- Optimization opportunities
- Cost efficiency

## Data Collection

Let me start by collecting comprehensive cluster data:

```bash
# Cluster overview
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get namespaces

# Workload inventory
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces
kubectl get services --all-namespaces -o wide
kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces 2>/dev/null || echo "No ingress resources"

# Storage inventory
kubectl get pvc --all-namespaces
kubectl get pv
kubectl get storageclass

# Events and issues
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -50
```

## Parallel Analysis Execution

I'll now launch specialized agents to analyze different aspects of your cluster:

### Pod Analyzer
Will examine:
- Pods in non-running states
- Restart patterns and issues
- Resource constraints
- Image and configuration problems

### Service Analyzer
Will examine:
- Service-endpoint mismatches
- Port configuration issues
- Load balancer problems
- DNS resolution

### Network Analyzer
Will examine:
- Ingress-backend connectivity
- Network policy effectiveness
- DNS configuration
- Inter-service communication

### Storage Analyzer
Will examine:
- Unbound PVCs
- Storage class issues
- Volume mounting problems
- Capacity constraints

### Security Analyzer
Will examine:
- RBAC permissions
- Security contexts
- Network policies
- Pod security standards

## Analysis Framework

Each agent will follow this structured approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant metrics and configuration
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common issues and anomalies
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine underlying causes
4. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate severity and scope
5. **Solution Recommendations**: Provide actionable fixes

## Expected Output Format

Each agent will return:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy|warning|critical",
  "summary": "Brief overview of findings",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
      "category": "configuration|performance|security|availability",
      "description": "Detailed issue description",
      "affected_resources": ["list of affected resources"],
      "root_cause": "Analysis of why this is happening",
      "remediation": "Specific steps to fix",
      "prevention": "How to avoid in future"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Optimization suggestions",
    "Best practice recommendations"
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "health_score": "0-100",
    "issue_count": "number of issues found",
    "critical_count": "number of critical issues"
  }
}
```

## Interactive Follow-up

After the parallel analysis completes, I'll:

1. **Consolidate Findings**: Combine results from all agents
2. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on most critical problems first
3. **Correlate Problems**: Identify related issues across different domains
4. **Provide Action Plan**: Create prioritized remediation roadmap
5. **Offer Deep Dives**: Investigate specific issues in detail

## Analysis Depth Options

I can perform analysis at different levels:

### Quick Scan (5 minutes)
- Basic health checks
- Critical issue detection
- High-level recommendations

### Standard Analysis (15 minutes)
- Comprehensive resource analysis
- Performance assessment
- Security baseline check

### Deep Analysis (30 minutes)
- Detailed configuration review
- Advanced optimization recommendations
- Threat modeling assessment
- Capacity planning analysis

Which level of analysis would you prefer? I'll start with the parallel agent execution and then synthesize the results into a comprehensive cluster health report.
