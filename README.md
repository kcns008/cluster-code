Cluster Code is a comprehensive CLI tool for building, maintaining, and troubleshooting Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters across on-premises, AWS, Azure, and GCP environments. Built on Cluster Code's agentic framework, it provides AI-powered cluster diagnostics, multi-cloud provisioning, and intelligent troubleshooting capabilities.

**Enhanced with [K8sGPT](https://k8sgpt.ai/) analyzers and powered by advanced AI diagnostics.**

## Plugin Architecture

This repository includes Cluster Code plugins that extend functionality with custom commands and agents:

- **cluster-core**: Core Kubernetes operations and resource management
- **k8sgpt-analyzers**: AI-powered cluster diagnostics and troubleshooting
- **cluster-openshift**: OpenShift-specific features and operators
- **gitops**: GitOps workflows and deployment automation
- **cloud-providers**: Multi-cloud cluster provisioning (coming soon)

See the [plugins directory](./plugins/README.md) for detailed documentation on available plugins.

## Quick Examples

### Diagnose Cluster Issues
```bash
# Run comprehensive cluster diagnostics
cluster-code diagnose

# Troubleshoot specific pod
cluster-code troubleshoot pod my-app-pod-xyz

# Analyze service connectivity
cluster-code analyze service my-service

# Check node health and resource pressure
cluster-code check nodes
```

### Interactive Troubleshooting
```bash
# Start chat-based troubleshooting
cluster-code chat

# Get help with specific issues
cluster-code chat "Why are my pods crashing?"
cluster-code chat "Help me debug service connectivity"
```

### Resource Management
```bash
# Scale deployment
cluster-code scale deployment my-app --replicas 5

# View pod logs
cluster-code logs pod my-app-pod-xyz --follow

# Describe any resource
cluster-code describe deployment my-app
cluster-code describe service my-service
cluster-code describe pvc my-data-volume
```
