# Cluster Code Usage Guide

## Interactive Natural Language Mode (Recommended)

Cluster Code now features an interactive natural language interface powered by AI. This is the recommended way to interact with your cluster - just describe what you want to do in plain English!

### Starting Interactive Mode

Simply run `cluster-code` with no arguments (after initial setup):

```bash
$ cluster-code
```

### Example Conversations

#### Example 1: Viewing Pod Status

```
You: Show me all pods in my namespace
